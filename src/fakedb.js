    description: "Happy Sunday gentlemen of this section I see almost everyday how men go about asking ladies for a date,burning date and airtime, trying to impress ladies which I find so disgusting.I don't know if it is a problem with me, but, I find it absurd, time and resource wasting to go days asking a lady out, buy things to impress her, call her every morning and send gifts just to have a woman around me.",

    description: "Manchester United has concluded its internal investigation into the allegations made against Mason Greenwood.Our process commenced in February 2023, following all charges against Mason being dropped. Throughout, we have taken into account the wishes, rights and perspective of the alleged victim along with the club’s standards and values, and sought to collate as much information and context as possible. This has required us to proceed with sensitivity and care to obtain evidence not in the public domain, including from those with direct knowledge of the case.Based on the evidence available to us, we have concluded that the material posted online did not provide a full picture and that Mason did not commit the offences in respect of which he was originally charged. That said, as Mason publicly acknowledges today, he has made mistakes which he is taking responsibility for.All those involved, including Mason, recognise the difficulties with him recommencing his career at Manchester United. It has therefore been mutually agreed that it would be most appropriate for him to do so away from Old Trafford, and we will now work with Mason to achieve that outcome.",
